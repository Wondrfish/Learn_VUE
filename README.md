I'm Learning vue


1. Root Folder (my-vue-app/)
This is the main directory of your project, containing all the necessary files and folders to run your Vue app.

2. node_modules/
📁 What it is:

Contains all the dependencies installed via npm (or yarn).

You don’t need to manually edit this folder.

It’s automatically created when you run npm install.

3. public/
📁 What it is:

Holds static files like index.html and images.

📄 index.html

The main HTML file where your Vue app is injected.

Vue mounts to the <div id="app"></div> inside this file.

📄 favicon.ico

The small icon displayed in the browser tab.

4. src/ (Source Code)
📁 What it is:

Contains your app’s actual Vue code.

📂 assets/

Stores static images, CSS, or fonts used in your components.

📂 components/

Contains reusable Vue components.

Example: If you make a Button.vue component, it goes here.

Acts as the main wrapper for your entire app.

📄 main.js

The entry point of the app.

Initializes Vue and mounts your app to #app in index.html.
